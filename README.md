# Obsidian-Vault-Template-Fork v1.2.0

## A Template For My Obsidian Vault Based Off Of CyanVoxel's

This is a copy of my Obsidian Vault that you can use as a template or inspiration for your vault.
This repository serves as a modified version of CyanVoxel's vault seen in their [Vault Tour](https://youtu.be/rAkerV8rlow) video, which you can watch for a full rundown of the appearance and plugins used in this vault.

This vault contains several of my other snippets, which you can find in their own (and updated) repositories here:

- [Colored Sidebar](https://github.com/CyanVoxel/Obsidian-Colored-Sidebar)
- [Daily Themes](https://github.com/CyanVoxel/Obsidian-Daily-Themes)
- [Notebook Themes](https://github.com/CyanVoxel/Obsidian-Notebook-Themes)
- [Game Themes](https://github.com/CyanVoxel/Obsidian-Game-Themes)

***NOTICE:** I likely won't be updating this repository often, as I recommend you build your own vault from default configurations, while discovering and changing settings as you go. Please check the repositories listed above as well as the plugins inside the vault in order to have an up to date experience.*

## How to import this vault (quick)

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.
2. Open Obsidian and choose "Open folder as vault" and point to the folder you downloaded.
3. Install the community plugins used (see the video linked above for a list). Many styles are enabled as CSS snippets in `.obsidian/snippets/` — enable the snippets in Settings → Appearance → CSS snippets.
4. If you want to start fresh, duplicate a template from `Vault/99 - Meta/00 - Templates/` and use it as your daily note template.

Demo and presets

- Demo note: `Vault/99 - Meta/Recolor Demo.md` (shows recolor pipeline).
- Presets snippet: `Vault/.obsidian/snippets/Recolor Variants.css` (enable it to try prebuilt color filters).
