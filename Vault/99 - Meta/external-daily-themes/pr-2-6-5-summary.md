# Applied fixes from CyanVoxel/Obsidian-Daily-Themes

This folder summarizes several closed PRs from the `Obsidian-Daily-Themes` repo that were applied (or are already present) in this vault.

- PR #2 (Update Daily Note Themes.css): Added uppercase day classes (e.g., `.Sunday`) and version bump. Changes already present in `Vault/.obsidian/snippets/Daily Note Themes.css`.
- PR #5 (Added priority to H4 width class): Applied â€” added `!important` to `width: fit-content` in `Vault/.obsidian/snippets/Daily Note Themes.css`.
- PR #6 (Fixed yaml syntax to work by default): Template changes to `(TEMPLATE) Daily.md` were applied (combined date format and removal of `tp.file.title` references present in `Vault/99 - Meta/00 - Templates/(TEMPLATE) Daily.md`).
- PR #11 (Typo): README fix; informational only.

If you want, I can also:
- Apply README wording changes from the remote repo's README into our `Vault/99 - Meta/` docs.
- Backport other non-code PRs as necessary.
